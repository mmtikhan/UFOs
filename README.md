## Summary
Although, the web page is fully functional there are some drawbacks and upgrades suggestion:

### Drawbacks
A user should manually fill the search criteria so there should be a drop menu that offers a user possible options for criteria and increases usability.

### Recommendations for future developments:
1. To allow users to search by UFO duration time.
2. To develop a possibility of adding a picture and video of UFO if they exist.
